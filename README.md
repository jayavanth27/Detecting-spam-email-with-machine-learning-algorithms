# Detecting-spam-email-with-machine-learning-algorithms
 Email is one of the most important tool where data exchange happens very frequently and it is 
 important to enhance security standards of user data. 
 
 Machine learning algorithms are applied to classify whether an Email is legitimate or not by 
 training the model with some training data. Few standard keywords are introduced to the 
 learning algorithm based on the content of the email present inside.
 
 Finally various learning algorithms are compared with each other based on the results it 
 Produced and the accuracy is calculated. The best model is taken and is used for GUI creation 
 for better visualization.
